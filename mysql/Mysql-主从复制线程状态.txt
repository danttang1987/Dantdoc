#常见状态说明：
#Master has sent all binlog to slave; waiting for binlog to be updated   线程目前为空闲状态，等待主服务器上的二进制日志更新；
#Sending binlog event to slave          线程已经从Binlog中读取了一个日志，正在将它发送给从服务器；
#Finished reading one binlog;swithing to next binlog    线程已经读完一个Binlog日志文件，并且正在打开下一个要发送的到从服务器的日志；
#waiting fo finalize termination      线程停止时发生的一个很简单的状态；

#从库I/O线程工作状态
The following list shows the most common states you may see in the State column for a slave server
SQL thread:
• Waiting for the next event in relay log
The initial state before Reading event from the relay log.
• Reading event from the relay log
The thread has read an event from the relay log so that the event can be processed.
• Making temp file
The thread is executing a LOAD DATA INFILE statement and is creating a temporary file containing
the data from which the slave will read rows.
• Slave has read all relay log; waiting for the slave I/O thread to update
it
The thread has processed all events in the relay log files, and is now waiting for the I/O thread to
write new events to the relay log.
• Waiting for slave mutex on exit
A very brief state that occurs as the thread is stopping.
The State column for the I/O thread may also show the text of a statement. This indicates that the
thread has read an event from the relay log, extracted the statement from it, and is executing it.


Replication Slave Connection Thread States
These thread states occur on a replication slave but are associated with connection threads, not with
the I/O or SQL threads.
• Changing master
The thread is processing a CHANGE MASTER TO statement.
• Killing slave
The thread is processing a STOP SLAVE statement.
• Opening master dump table
This state occurs after Creating table from master dump.
• Reading master dump table data
This state occurs after Opening master dump table.
• Rebuilding the index on master dump table
This state occurs after Reading master dump table data.
